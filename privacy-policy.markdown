<section>
  <p><em>Neural Swarm Inc. (“Neural Swarm”)</em> operates <em>neuralswarm.com</em>. It is <em>Neural Swarm’s</em> policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

  <h2 class="fs-6 fw-bold my-4">1. Website Visitors</h2>
  <p>Like most website operators, <em>Neural Swarm</em> collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. <em>Neural Swarm’s</em> purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how <em>Neural Swarm’s</em> visitors use its website. From time to time, <em>Neural Swarm</em> may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
  <p><em>Neural Swarm</em> also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <em>neuralswarm.com</em> blogs. <em>Neural Swarm</em> only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

<section>
  <h2 class="fs-6 fw-bold my-4">2. Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
  <p>Certain visitors to <em>Neural Swarm’s</em> websites choose to interact with <em>Neural Swarm</em> in ways that require <em>Neural Swarm</em> to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that <em>Neural Swarm</em> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at <em>neuralswarm.com</em> to provide their name, email address and a username. Those who engage in transactions with <em>Neural Swarm</em> are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, <em>Neural Swarm</em> collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with <em>Neural Swarm</em>. <em>Neural Swarm</em> does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<section>
  <h2 class="fs-6 fw-bold my-4">3. Aggregated Statistics</h2>
  <p><em>Neural Swarm</em> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, <em>Neural Swarm</em> may monitor the most popular products on the <em>neuralswarm.com</em> site. <em>Neural Swarm</em> may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, <em>Neural Swarm</em> does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<section>
  <h2 class="fs-6 fw-bold my-4">4. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
  <p><em>Neural Swarm</em> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on <em>Neural Swarm’s</em> behalf or to provide services available at <em>Neural Swarm’s</em> websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using <em>Neural Swarm’s</em> websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. <em>Neural Swarm</em> will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, <em>Neural Swarm</em> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when <em>Neural Swarm</em> believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of <em>Neural Swarm</em>, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. <em>Neural Swarm</em> takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

  <h2 class="fs-6 fw-bold my-4">6. Business Transfers</h2>
  <p>If <em>Neural Swarm</em>, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that <em>Neural Swarm</em> goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of <em>Neural Swarm</em> may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
